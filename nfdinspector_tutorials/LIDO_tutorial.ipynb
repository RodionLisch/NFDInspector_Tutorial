    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "NFDInspector is designed to facilitate the inspection of formal quality issues pertaining to research data. It is currently compatible with the LIDO and EAD metadata standards. The project has been funded by the “4Memory Incubator Funds” of the NFDI4Memory consortium and is being developed and maintained by the Montanhistorisches Dokumentationszentrum (montan.dok) of the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Group\n",
    "This tutorial is aimed at new users of the NFDInspector. The aim is to make it easier to get started using the tool based on a use case presented here. A basic understanding of Python programming is required to use the tool independently. Due to the open source architecture, the tool can be integrated into other programs, tools and applications. In its stand-alone form, the tool is used via a command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "It is assumed that a current version of Python is installed on the machine. No further libraries are required for the basic functions. Nevertheless, the installation of packages that are required for further use is recommended:\n",
    "+ __[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)__\n",
    "+ __[numpy](https://numpy.org/)__\n",
    "+ __[lxml](https://lxml.de/)__\n",
    "+ __[json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)__\n",
